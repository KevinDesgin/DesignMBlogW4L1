# Black Box Activity 
During the lesson, I was introduced to Adobe Illustrator for the first time. The class learned some basic commands and controls. Which led to the first activity of desgining 48 different illustration using only 4 solid black square for each one. 8 of those desgin must fit into the following 6 theme being order, increase, bold, congested, tension and playful. Before watching the tutorial, some of my square look a bit more rectanglar and I was working slow due to forgetting to switch between different tools. After watching the tutorial, I applied the contrain command to fix the shape to be squares. As well as using the rotating the shapes. One thing I also did outside the tutorial is clip mask the background so that the shapes would only appear in the white box.
