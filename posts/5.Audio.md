Here I learnt the process to code an instruction that allows users to hear a short audio sound when clicking on the icon. With the addition to learning how to cut, fade and eq my sounds on adobe audition.

Similary to the swapping icon, I had the problem where the audio is not registered properly. So I had to export the audio again in order to get the sound for the cat icon to work.
