The music icon should serve the purpose for adjusting the background music. So I drew any object that has associaiton of music. Although I should have thought clearly of how the icon would change. With that in mind, I think that the top middle sketch should be ideal icon. The use of curved lines gives an airey effect and the shape of clouds unites to create a calm atmosphere. In addition to the sketch of the headphone representing the music aspect of the sketch.
