Here I learnt how to import the images to html. As well as giving id to each images, learning how sizing the browser can effect the icon and learn how to give instruction to allow the icons to transition from its first frame to its second frame. I also searched up how to change the background colour in order to keep my intended aesthetic of a calm atmosphere.

<p>I had this problem of the images not swapping due to the use of using the same identifier. However this was quickly fixed by naming the different identifier by their id name. (Instead of all identifer being "circle_element", it is now "sound", "build", "cat"...)</p>

<p> There was also the issue where deno deploy could not find the second frame of the time icon. This was solved by exporting the same icon straight from illustrator again. </p>
