The music icon should serve the purpose for adjusting the background music. So I drew any object that had an associaiton of music. Although I should have thought clearly of how the icon would change. With that in mind, I think that the top middle sketch should be ideal icon. The use of curved lines gives an airey effect and the shape of clouds unites to create a calm atmosphere. In addition to the sketch of the headphone representing the music aspect of the sketch.

The setting icon is a very important tool that serves the purpose as an all purpose tool that adjust the platform itself. So I tried to draw different icon with additional object in relation to the theme "calm". With that in mind, I think that the bottom left sketch should be the ideal icon. The use of curved line on the leaves creates calm effect.

The sound icon should serve the purpose for adjusting the background audio. Similar to the music icon, I drew object that had an association to audio. With that in mind, I think that the middle left icon should be the ideal icon. The use of sketch lines and curved lines should create that tranquil effect.

The build icon should serve the purpose for generating the users own world. With this in mind, I think that the top left setck should be the ideal icon. Although I think that the the conrers of each line should be curveds so that the icon looks smoother and lighter.
