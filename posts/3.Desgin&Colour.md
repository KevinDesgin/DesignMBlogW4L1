<p> Here are my design icon. I mainly chose the desgins with one hue. The reason behind this choice was that the colour blue is mostly idealized as the colour that associates with the mood of calm. </br>
In some of my design, I decided to muck around with the gradient tool. Which can be seen on the strokes of most icons. I came to like these desgins as it gave it this neo sign lighting that allows the icon to illuminate. </br>
There were also filling errors due to how I created my strokes with the pen tool. Fortunatly this was solved with the add anchor point tool by adding archor point close to the original and deleting it. Then with a few averging and joining archor point. I was able to fill the colour. <p>
